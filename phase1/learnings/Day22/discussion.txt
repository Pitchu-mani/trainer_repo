    operator overloading : to give definition of the particular operator 
                           to operate on objects of user defined data type 

    one operator operates different types of data: overloading op 
    samed named many functions                   : overloading fn 
        having different types of args 
                         order of args 
                         number of args 
    more than one constructor                   : overloading constructor

what is local variable?
    "
    the variable declared inside the function 
    and 
    arguments of the function 
    are called 
    local variables. "

    visibility: only within the function  
    life-time: only within the function
    definition of local variable without initialization: 
            by defualt the value is garbage 
    is there declaration for local variable? 
        No. Declaration and Definition are at a time. 

what is global variable?
    "
    the variable common to all the functions 
    whose memory allocated only once 
    and alive throughout the program 
    "
    visibility: througout entire the program  ie every function 
    life-time: througout entire the program
    definition of global variable without initialization: 
            by defualt the value is 0
            (all the bits of memory are 0)
    is there declaration for global variable? 
        Yes. 
        There is declaration of global variable by extern keyword. 
        Then the global variable will be defined later in any module. 

what is variable declaration?
    "introduce the identifier name for the variable" variable declaration 
    so that compiler aware the identifier 

    Number of time to declare the variable? 
        Only one time 

    1. static member data of class is declared in the class definition 
       static member data will be defined outside the class definition 
    2. global variable can be declared in many modules using extern keyword
       global variable can be defined later in one of modules 
            generally it is main module 
what is variable definition?
    memory allocation of the variable 
    is variable definition 
what is function declaration? Number of time declartion: only one time 
    "introduce the identifier name for the function
    with signature
    such return type and args types of fn" variable declaration
what is function definition? 
    "implementation of the code of the function" 
what is variable memory allocation? 
    variable definition 
what is extern keyword?
    global variable declaration 
what are all storage classes in C++?

    What was there in C lang? 
                                     local              global              local to vis

                                  ---------------   ----------------     ----------

                    declaration   fn     fn              outside all fns      fn

    Now what is in C++ lang? 
        register storage class is removed from c++ 11.
        keyword auto was used in C for automatic storage class. 
        Now, no need to use auto keyword for the variables

        Now, from C++ 11, the keyword auto takes different meaning 
        not for storage class ****

        auto takes the meaning "automatic type deducer".

What is usage of static keyword in C language? 
    In C lang, 
    1. static keyword used for static storage class variable 
    2. static keyword used to specify the function as private to the module 

    C lang :
        1. Hospital Management System 
            Patient.h 
                void patient_create();
            Doctor.h 
                void doctor_create();
            Patient Management (Patient.c)
                #include "Patient.h"
                static void _create() {
                    //actual code for patient create functionality 
                }

                void patient_create()
                {
                   _create();     
                }
            Doctor Management (Doctor.c)
                #include "Doctor.h"
                static void _create() {
                    //actual code for doctor create functionality 
                }

                void doctor_create()
                {
                   _create();     
                }
What is usage of static keyword in C++ language? 
    In C lang, 
    1. static keyword used for static storage class variable 
    2. static keyword used to specify the function as private to the module 
    3. static keyword used to specify class level members 
        we call it as "static members of the class" 


Talk about memory layout of C++ program/process.
    1. CL args + env vars 
    2. stack                            : arg, local vars 
    3. heap                             : dynamic mem 
    4. global                           : global vars = external + static 
        4.1. unintialized data (bss)    
        4.2. intialized data 
    5. text                             : main, functions etc code 

    stack and heap grows opposite direction.

    cout << "addr of id=" << (&(*(&id))) << endl;   // reference of value : addr 
    cout << "value of id=" << (*(&(*(&id)))) << endl; // dereference the ref : value 
}
     

//pointer | dynamic memory 
// c dynamic memory vs c++ dynamic memory 



C code for dynamic memory 
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    //int* ptrId;//WILD PTR 
    int* ptrId = NULL;//WILD behaviour is not there
    //cout << "dyn mem=" << *ptrId << endl;
    ptrId = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));//void*
    *ptrId = 100;
    cout << "addr of dyn mem=" << ptrId << endl;
    cout << "dyn mem=" << *ptrId << endl;

    //free(ptrId);
    //cout << "dyn mem=" << *ptrId << endl;//Dangling PTR

    free(ptrId);
    ptrId = NULL; //No dangling 
    //cout << "dyn mem=" << *ptrId << endl;//Dangling PTR access is not possible 
    return 0;
}


//
1. Dont declare pointer with garbage 
   OR 
   Declare pointer with NULL / nullptr 
    to avoid WILD ptr 
2. After dealloc make poiter as NULL 
 to avoid dangling pointer

3. what is dynamic memory management? 
    every alloc' there must be dealloc'. - dynamic memory management 
    "every 'new' op there must be call for 'delete' op'" - memory management 

    what is memory dismanagement? 
    all alloc' mem blocks to be dealloc'ed. 
    If such thing is not happening, 
    then we call it as memory dismanagement.

    what is memory leak / memory hole? 
    Program some functions 
        if alloc'ted mem blocks are not dealloc'ed 
        and no longer used also 
        and they will not be used further also 
        then it is called memory hole. 
4. what is option available nowaday to do mem mgment or 
 non-mem dismgmt?

    using smartpointers in C++.

what is array? 
    "array is variable to hold multiple data 
        and each data is accessed index number"

    "
    indexed sequencial multiple data 
    "

    "
    built-in data type to hold multiple data of same type 
    we declare array to hold multiple data 
    as 
        TYPE arr[SIZE];

        Here, arr is name of the array. 
    "

    int ids[4];

    here ids is the array of size 4.

    to access elements of the array 
    ids[0] to access first element 
    ids[1] to access second element 
    etc 


    array is constant pointer
    which holds base address.
