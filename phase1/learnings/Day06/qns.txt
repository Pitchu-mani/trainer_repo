1. Define Unnormalized Form (UNF) and explain why it may not be ideal for database design.
   
2. Given a table with repeating groups of data, describe the steps needed to convert it from UNF to the First Normal Form (1NF).

3. What is a primary key, and why is it important when transforming a table into 1NF?

4. Explain the concept of partial dependency and why it is an issue in 1NF.

5. After converting a table to 1NF, identify the steps to move it to Second Normal Form (2NF).

6. Describe the difference between 1NF and 2NF in terms of dependencies. Give an example.

7. Explain transitive dependency and why itâ€™s an issue in the Second Normal Form (2NF).

8. Given a table in 2NF with transitive dependencies, outline the process of converting it to Third Normal Form (3NF).

9. How does 3NF improve data integrity compared to 2NF? Provide a practical example.

10. What is the difference between partial, transitive, and full dependencies in normalization, and how does each relate to UNF, 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF?



1. Convert the following unnormalized table into 1NF:
   ```

   ----------|---------|---------------------
   1         | Alice   | Math, English, Science
   2         | Bob     | Math, History
   ```
   *Ensure each course is separated correctly for 1NF.*

2. Given the following table in 1NF, convert it to 2NF:
   ```
   OrderID | ProductID | OrderDate | CustomerID | CustomerName | ProductName
   --------|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|------------
   101     | P1        | 2024-11-01| C1         | John Doe     | Widget A
   101     | P2        | 2024-11-01| C1         | John Doe     | Widget B
   ```
   *Identify partial dependencies and create separate tables.*

3. Normalize the following table from 1NF to 2NF:
   ```
   EmployeeID | Name   | ProjectID | ProjectName | HoursWorked
   -----------|--------|-----------|-------------|------------
   1          | Alice  | 201       | Alpha       | 40
   1          | Alice  | 202       | Beta        | 20
   2          | Bob    | 201       | Alpha       | 30
   ```
   *Remove partial dependencies and split the table accordingly.*

4. Convert this 2NF table to 3NF:
   ```
   StudentID | CourseID | InstructorID | InstructorName | InstructorPhone
   ----------|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------
   S1        | C101     | I1           | Dr. Smith      | 123-456-7890
   S2        | C102     | I2           | Prof. Johnson  | 098-765-4321
   ```
   *Identify transitive dependencies and split the table further.*

5. Normalize the following unnormalized data into 3NF:
   ```
   InvoiceNo | CustomerName | CustomerAddress | Item | Quantity | Price
   ----------|--------------|-----------------|------|----------|------
   1001      | Alice        | 123 Maple St    | Pen  | 10       | 1.50
   1001      | Alice        | 123 Maple St    | Notebook | 5   | 3.00
   ```
   *Ensure each level of normalization is followed step by step.*

6. Convert this 1NF table to 3NF:
   ```
   LibraryID | BookTitle | AuthorName | AuthorAddress | PublisherName
   ----------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------
   L1        | Book A    | Author X   | 789 Pine St   | Publisher Y
   L2        | Book B    | Author Y   | 101 Oak St    | Publisher Z
   ```
   *Start with 1NF, remove partial dependencies for 2NF, and transitive dependencies for 3NF.*

7. Normalize the following data from UNF to 3NF:
   ```
   CustomerID | Name      | Orders (OrderID, OrderDate, Amount)
   -----------|-----------|-------------------------------------
   1          | John Doe  | (101, 2024-10-10, 250), (102, 2024-10-12, 300)
   ```
   *Separate repeating groups, then apply 2NF and 3NF as needed.*

8. Convert this table in 2NF to 3NF:
   ```
   ProductID | ProductName | SupplierID | SupplierName | SupplierPhone
   ----------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------
   P1        | Widget A    | S1         | Supplier X   | 555-1234
   P2        | Widget B    | S2         | Supplier Y   | 555-5678
   ```
   *Identify and remove transitive dependencies.*

9. Normalize the following data from UNF to 3NF:
   ```
   OrderID | CustomerName | Product (ProductID, ProductName, Quantity)
   --------|--------------|--------------------------------------------
   1       | Alice        | (P1, Widget A, 2), (P2, Widget B, 3)
   ```
   *Start by separating repeating groups, then apply 2NF and 3NF.*

10. Given this 1NF table, convert it to 3NF:
    ```
    DepartmentID | DepartmentName | ManagerID | ManagerName | Location
    -------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|---------
    D1           | Sales          | M1        | Alice       | NY
    D2           | IT             | M2        | Bob         | SF
    ```
    *Remove partial dependencies for 2NF, then transitive dependencies for 3NF.*
