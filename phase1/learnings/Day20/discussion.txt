what is function in bash shell scripting?
    - sub shell script 
        which is called within main script like in HLL 
    - we may call the main script 
        with command line args as positional args or options based args 
      so that similar way only we can run the sub script (function in scripting)
        function can receive args as positional or options based 
    
      positional args of the function will be read as $1 $2 $3 etc 
      $# number of positional args 

      what is the return value out of the shell scripting function?
        exit code 
            -- success code 
            -- failure code 
    - how I will receive the output out of the shell scripting function? 
        by echo'ing result then read it. enough.
