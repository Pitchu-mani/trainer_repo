    Existing system: 
    - for our bookings crud operations 
    -       all the functions operate on same data.
    -       all the data are passed as arguments.
    Propsed system:
    - the data we put as class members 
    - the functions now will receive any arguments 
    - so the functions will operate on data which are now members of the class       
    /phase1/learnings/Day18/cpp/crud01.cpp 
BookingManager 
    - int booking_ids[], 
    - int ticket_amounts[], 
    - int food_amounts[], 
    - int numBookings
    + create();
    + display();
    + findIndexById(id);
    + editById();
    + deleteById();

    Existing system: 
    - for our bookings crud operations 
    -       all the functions operate on different array each represent single data.
    -       if we go many such data, there will so many arrays we have to manage 
    Propsed system:
    - we will define a class for all single data, so that the class is becoming the composite data 
    - we will do the crud operations on composite data 
        so taht we will manage only bookings arrays where booking is the object. 
Booking:
    - id
    - ticket_amount
    - food_amount
    + Booking
    
BookingManager
    - Booking bookings[]
    - int numBookings

#004
    Solve problem:
        We have the hospital stay. 
        We have some aggregators operations like min, max, 2nd min, 2nd max 
            - all aggregators operates on parameters which are arrays 
            
    To do: 
        use stays array.
            to manage crud operations on hospital stay. 
            +
            to do aggregators on entire stays  

                4 crud operations menus 
                4 aggregators menus 
        menu driven program 
            
                                           owner  group  other
