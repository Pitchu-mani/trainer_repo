Here’s a visualization of how `vtable` and `vptr` 
work in the context of your C++ code 
with dynamic binding. 

We'll look at how the `vptr` (virtual pointer) and 
`vtable` (virtual table) enable the correct function 
to be called at runtime.

Code Overview:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Bird {
public:
    virtual void Sound() = 0; // Pure virtual function (abstract)
    virtual ~Bird() {}  // Virtual destructor
};

class Crow : public Bird {
public:
    void Sound() override { 
        std::cout << "Crow caws..." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Parrot : public Bird {
public:
    void Sound() override { 
        std::cout << "Parrot squawks..." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Bird* crow = new Crow();   // Create Crow object
    Bird* parrot = new Parrot(); // Create Parrot object

    crow->Sound();  // Calls Crow's Sound
    parrot->Sound(); // Calls Parrot's Sound

    delete crow;  // Cleanup
    delete parrot; // Cleanup

    return 0;
}
```

Step-by-Step Visualization:

#1. `Object Creation`
When you create objects of `Crow` and `Parrot` 
using `new`, the `vptr` is set up 
inside each object to point to the correct `vtable`.

`Memory Layout`:
- `Crow Object`:
  - vptr points to `Crow`'s vtable.
  - vtable for `Crow` has a pointer to `Crow::Sound`.

- `Parrot Object`:
  - vptr points to `Parrot`'s vtable.
  - vtable for `Parrot` has a pointer to `Parrot::Sound`.

```
+-------------------+       +---------------------+
|     Crow Object   |       |     Parrot Object   |
+-------------------+       +---------------------+
| vptr → [vtable]   |       | vptr → [vtable]     |
+-------------------+       +---------------------+
```

#2. `Vtable for Crow and Parrot`

- `Crow's vtable`:
  ```
  vtable_Crow:  [Crow::Sound]
  ```

- `Parrot's vtable`:
  ```
  vtable_Parrot: [Parrot::Sound]
  ```

#3. `Virtual Function Call (`crow->Sound()`)`
When you call `crow->Sound()`, C++ uses the `vptr` 
in the `Crow` object to find the `vtable` for `Crow`. 

It then looks up `Sound()` in that vtable and calls `Crow::Sound()`.

- The `vptr` of the `Crow` object points to `vtable_Crow`.
- The `vtable` contains a pointer to `Crow::Sound()`, 
which is then executed.

#4. `Virtual Function Call (`parrot->Sound()`)`
When you call `parrot->Sound()`, C++ uses the `vptr` 
in the `Parrot` object to find the `vtable` for `Parrot`. 
It then looks up `Sound()` in that vtable and calls `Parrot::Sound()`.

- The `vptr` of the `Parrot` object points to `vtable_Parrot`.
- The `vtable` contains a pointer to `Parrot::Sound()`, 
which is then executed.

#5. `Destruction (delete crow, delete parrot)`
When you delete `crow` and `parrot`, 
the `virtual destructor` (`~Bird()`) is invoked. 
The `vptr` will again ensure the correct destructor is called.

Visualization Diagram:

```
+------------------+     +---------------------+
|   Crow Object    |     |   Parrot Object     |
|------------------|     |---------------------|
| vptr → [vtable]  |---->| vptr → [vtable]     |
+------------------+     +---------------------+

vtable_Crow:  [Crow::Sound]      vtable_Parrot: [Parrot::Sound]

crow->Sound() → [vptr] → vtable_Crow → Crow::Sound()
parrot->Sound() → [vptr] → vtable_Parrot → Parrot::Sound()

```

Dynamic Dispatch Process:
1. `crow->Sound()`:
   - `vptr` of the `crow` object points to `vtable_Crow`.
   - `vtable_Crow` contains a pointer to `Crow::Sound`.
   - The function `Crow::Sound` is called.

2. `parrot->Sound()`:
   - `vptr` of the `parrot` object points to `vtable_Parrot`.
   - `vtable_Parrot` contains a pointer to `Parrot::Sound`.
   - The function `Parrot::Sound` is called.

Conclusion:
- The `vptr` ensures 
that the correct version of the virtual function is called 
by pointing to the appropriate `vtable`.
- The `vtable` contains pointers to the overridden functions, and 
when a virtual function is called, 
the program follows the `vptr` to find the correct function in the `vtable`.

This is how dynamic dispatch works using `vtable` and `vptr` in C++.
