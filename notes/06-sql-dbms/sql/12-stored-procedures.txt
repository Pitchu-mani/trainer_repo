`Stored Procedures in Oracle`

A `stored procedure` 
in Oracle is a named block of PL/SQL code 
that performs a specific task and can be reused multiple times. 
It is stored in the database and executed as needed.

---

`Advantages of Stored Procedures`

1. `Code Reusability`: Can be called multiple times, 
    reducing redundancy.
2. `Performance`: Precompiled and stored in the database, 
    leading to faster execution.
3. `Security`: Permissions can be granted on procedures 
    instead of base tables.
4. `Modularity`: Helps organize code into logical units.
5. `Reduced Network Traffic`: 
    Executes on the server side, 
    reducing data transfer overhead.

`Components of a Stored Procedure`

1. `Header`: Includes the procedure name and parameters.
2. `Declaration Section` *(optional)*: 
    Variables, cursors, or other local elements are declared.
3. `Execution Section`: Contains the main logic of the procedure.
4. `Exception Handling` *(optional)*: Manages runtime errors.

`Syntax for Creating a Stored Procedure`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name 
    (parameter1 IN datatype, parameter2 OUT datatype, ...)
AS
  -- Declaration section (optional)
BEGIN
  -- Execution section (mandatory)
  -- Your PL/SQL code goes here
EXCEPTION
  -- Exception handling section (optional)
END procedure_name;
```

`Example 1: A Simple Stored Procedure`

Create a procedure to calculate the bonus of an employee 
based on their salary.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE calculate_bonus (
  emp_id IN NUMBER,
  bonus OUT NUMBER
)
AS
  salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
  -- Retrieve employee salary
  SELECT salary INTO salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = emp_id;

  -- Calculate bonus (10% of salary)
  bonus := salary * 0.10;
END calculate_bonus;
```

#Call the Procedure:
```sql
DECLARE
  emp_bonus NUMBER;
BEGIN
  calculate_bonus(101, emp_bonus);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Bonus: ' || emp_bonus);
END;
```

---

`Example 2: Stored Procedure with DML`

Create a procedure to update an employee's department.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_department (
  emp_id IN NUMBER,
  new_dept_id IN NUMBER
)
AS
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees
  SET department_id = new_dept_id
  WHERE employee_id = emp_id;

  COMMIT;
END update_department;
```

#Call the Procedure:
```sql
BEGIN
  update_department(101, 30);
END;
```

`IN, OUT, and IN OUT Parameters`

1. `IN`: Passes a value to the procedure (read-only).
2. `OUT`: Returns a value from the procedure.
3. `IN OUT`: Passes a value to the procedure and allows it to be updated and returned.

#Example Using All Parameter Types:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE manage_employee (
  emp_id IN NUMBER,
  salary_increase IN OUT NUMBER,
  new_salary OUT NUMBER
)
AS
BEGIN
  -- Calculate new salary
  new_salary := salary_increase + (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id);

  -- Update salary
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = new_salary
  WHERE employee_id = emp_id;

  COMMIT;
END manage_employee;
```

---

`Dropping a Stored Procedure`

To remove a stored procedure from the database:
```sql
DROP PROCEDURE procedure_name;
```

---

`Debugging Stored Procedures`

1. Use `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE` to display debug messages.
2. Use Oracle SQL Developer for step-by-step debugging.

---

`Best Practices for Stored Procedures`

1. `Use Parameters`: Avoid hardcoding values to make procedures flexible.
2. `Error Handling`: Use the `EXCEPTION` block to handle errors gracefully.
3. `Avoid Overloading`: Use descriptive procedure names to avoid confusion.
4. `Grant Necessary Permissions`: Use `GRANT EXECUTE ON procedure_name` to allow others to use the procedure.
