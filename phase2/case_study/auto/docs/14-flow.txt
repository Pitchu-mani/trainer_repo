Here’s a detailed approach to creating flowcharts 
for each page of your C++ console application. 
I will create the flowcharts for the following pages:

1. Main Menu  
2. Driver Registration  
3. Login  
4. Driver Dashboard  
5. Admin Dashboard

Let’s define the process for each one.

1. Main Menu Flowchart
Steps:
1. Start the application.
2. Display the main menu with options:
   - Driver Registration
   - Login
   - Exit
3. Take user input for the menu option.
4. Redirect based on the input:
   - Driver Registration → Go to the registration page.
   - Login → Go to the login page.
   - Exit → Terminate the application.

Steps:

Would you like me to create graphical representations 
for these detailed flowcharts? 
If so, I can provide image-based or 
editable flowchart diagrams.
