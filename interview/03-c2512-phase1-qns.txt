    1)How linker is working in compilation of a file
    2)What is Static function
    3) 2 types of polymorphism 
    4)What is Virtual keyword 
    5)Compare Agile and waterfall 
    6)Use of Cat command
    7)Command to change permissions in a file or directory 
    8)Static library and Shared library
    9)STL
    10)Abstract class
    11)How to deallocate the dynamic memory we used
    12)There is a copy constructor by default so when we the copy constructor manually

    PROGRAM:
        •Define a class named student
        •Define a char pointer variable as member variable with any one access specifier
        •Define a constructor with this char pointer variable as parameter 
        •close the class
        •Define a main method
        •initialize a char array with a string value
        •Create an object for the class and pass this array as argument

    THEORY QUESTIONS:
    1) Explain steps in SDLC and STLC?
    2) Explain inheritance and types of inheritance 
        (like public, private and protected)?
    3) What is smart pointer and why we use it?
    4) What are the class relationships? (Composition and Aggregation).
    5) What is thread? What is multi threading and 
    what are the advantages of using multi threading?
    6) Do you know about inter process communication?
    7) What is exception handling and 
        how can we implement exception handling.
        give example (Real life example also)?
    8) Explain conditional compilation?
    9) What is memory leak?    
    PROGRAM QUESTIONS:
        1) Define an abstract class.
        2) Add a pure virtual function in that.
        3) Create a Derived class which inherit the base class.
        4) Override that base class function.
        5) In the main function create an object of the derived class. 
            Dynamically allocate memory.
        6) Also can we make object of abstract class?
